positive: Safety isnt always amazing, but what can you expect from a school in the heart of Toronto. Social is hard but not if you look for it. Overall decent school, really enjoying my time here and there's so much opportunity around. Lots of places to sit and study and very accommodating for many different things. There is something for everyone here.
neutral: TMU is a good and diverse school. Being in the heart of Toronto is an incredible experience and there are many things around you such as food courts, malls, grocery stores, etc. Safety is probably the biggest concern but that's what you can expect from a school in downtown. The social life is pretty bad because most people commute so no one stays.
neutral: Overall it's a great school in the heart of Toronto. Lots of opportunity, easy to use student hub, scheduling is easy. The social aspect lacks since TMU is a commuter school so most people are not looking to socialize outside of class. Safety also majorly lacks as there has been numerous incidents.
positive: If you want the tools to change the world to be more equitable and improve human rights, this place is a good start.
positive: I am a student there, location is very convenient but unfortunately it is in the heart of Toronto meaning that you will be met by many different people (many of them need a cent or two to get their coffee) and will also be met by crazy housing prices. Overall great experience with capable staff and welcoming atmosphere.
neutral: Good vibes but competitive. Needs more residence space considering downtown location. Fantastic Frosh events but is difficult to meet people outside of class due to large numbers commuting. Class scheduling sucks & trying to change programs is a nightmare. Victoria St not safe due to the homeless population in front of the public health centre.
positive: Overall I would give the university a solid 4/5. It has a good and diverse community so you don't feel left out but I would say the university's system as a whole, like class scheduling, teaching instructors, and ability to get on campus jobs could improve.
neutral: Pros: Offers lots of online courses Close to subway Cons: Programs in the Arts are limited and have many required courses Course options are limited Sketchy people on campus, especially closer to Dundas (though I've never felt like it was unsafe during the day)
negative: The location of the university is inviting to the homeless population and causes significant safety issues to all. The greatest issue is how much of the faculty is in a situation where English is not their principle language, making communication very difficult. If you're looking for a bloated/incompetent administration, this is the place to be.
negative: The university has no regard for their students. Most professors I have had just lecture slides they have bought from another professor (usually from University of Toronto) sometimes not even having read them in advance.
neutral: Had a solid first year staying at DCC. Lots of areas to chill or study around campus. Pretty nice location with the Eaton Centre, TTC, and lots of food in the surrounding areas. SLC was a great place to hang out around!
neutral: The location is pretty great; TTC, the mall, and restaurants are close by. However, I would definitely avoid walking around alone when the sun goes down, ladies.
positive: Overall, it's a great school! It has a positive atmosphere vibing with life and action. :)
negative: If you don't have any social skills you'll fit right in. NOT the place to meet people. It's more expensive than other universities but it's worse. Some programs are great, like psych (amazing profs), a toad could pass business-related programs, philosophy department is mid, and the sociology department are blue-haired communists feminists. AVOID.
neutral: Being a commuter school, it’s hard to have a decent social life unless you live on campus. Some of the buildings are super old and run down. And safety is pretty much nonexistent ?
positive: Love the location, makes it feel so much more uplifting and hardly like school and mandatory classes. Because of the location, there's many resources near by. Safety is awful, couldn't be worse. Feels very unsafe and dangerous more often than not. I always avoid campus later on in the day and avoid walking alone.
positive: Heart of downtown, want food? EATON centre 2 minute walk. Professors are extremely friendly and everyone has the opportunity to get an A+ with proper devotion. Location is convenient. The safety around MAC is questionable but there aren’t too many classes there anyways. People are quite friendly and approachable but you MUST make the first move.
positive: Awesome school in a great location. If youre in the GTA this will be the best option.
